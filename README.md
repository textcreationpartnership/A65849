CHRIST Ascended above the Clouds, &c.JOHN NEWMAN's Instance to prove the Scriptures the Word, Isa. 2
    _ CHRIST Ascended above the Clouds, &c.

    _ And now J. N. here follows a few of thy gross Lyes and slanderous Accusations laid down and implyed against us, which I return back upon thy own head.

    _ The Baptist and Presbyter, &c. conjunct against us, to their own Disjunction and Confusion. OR, A Relation of some Heads of Two Discourses (in London); the first whereof was the 28th of the 10th Month (69.) at which Thomas Danson (formerly Priest of Sandwich in Kent) and William Kiffin Baptist [with the Assistance of Ald. Hayes] joyned against us.

    _ At the Second Discourse which was the 20th of the 11th Month, 1669. Will. Kiffin and his Brother Jeremiah Ives, with some others appeared against us: Some of their Contradictions follow.

    _ These few Questions are for W. Kiffin, and the rest, who own him in his Principle.

    _ Here follows a few Doctrines asserted by one — Wheatly at Lambeth, in a Book directed in Manuscript to one Mr. Cox (as he calls him): this Wheatley seems to be a Brother of these Baptists, by his opposing the Light within, and pleading for their outward Forms, and their Water-Baptism, from the Example of Christ's going down into the Water to be Baptized of John.

    _ Here followeth a Copy of the Baptists Bill of Excommunication.

    _ Here followeth a Copy of the said Hester Bird (now Hester Andrews) her Answer.

    _ A few brief Observations on the Scriptures in the Margent of the Baptists Bill (or rather Bull) against the said Hester Bird, alias Andrews; which they have perverted and misapplyed: As,

1. John Newman set against himself: HIS Book and corrupt Principles being Answered by John Newman himself. His Principles and Contradictions are Collected and set opposite in his own words, and the Pages of his Book cited where they are, and briefly Noted, and Annimadvertized upon particularly, as followeth. Whereto is added, Tho. Danson, W. Kiffin, and Jer. Ives their Contradictions.
